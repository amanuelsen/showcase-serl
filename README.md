# ShowcaseSERL

ShowcaseSERL is a curated collection of student and researcher- developed projects. It serves as a public portfolio for finished projects and inspires students to contribute their project ideas.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development

To ensure a consistent code style, this project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can run the following command to check for linting errors and format the code:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:fix
```
