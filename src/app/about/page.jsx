          <h2 className='mb-2 text-xl font-semibold'>Project Overview</h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            ShowcaseSERL is a curated collection of student and
            researcher-developed projects. It serves as a public portfolio for
            finished projects and inspires students to contribute their project
            ideas.
          </p>

          <h2 className='mb-2 text-xl font-semibold'>Project Description</h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            In academic settings, students frequently develop projects as part
            of their coursework, while researchers create demonstrators and
            utilities intended to assist their peers. Unfortunately, these
            efforts often remain unseen, limiting their potential impact and
            collaboration opportunities.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            ShowcaseSERL aims to highlight these projects, providing a platform
            to increase their visibility. By showcasing student and researcher
            work, we intend to foster greater engagement, encourage
            contributions to existing projects, or inspire new ideas.
          </p>

          <h2 className='mb-2 text-xl font-semibold'>Purpose</h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            ShowcaseSERL serves two purposes: it functions as a web application
            for browsing projects and as a kiosk display on a TV, showcasing
            these projects in a public setting (e.g., using a Raspberry Pi in
            kiosk mode).
